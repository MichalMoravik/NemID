- add everywhere UNIQUE ? 
- docker
- add everywhere comments + change error messages
- add transactions everywhere where suitable (where more commands) to avoid expensive communication with DB
- HTTPS ?

questions:
- elaborate DB in case 3 pls. FKs are not stated. What is State? How is it connected?
- Should I use UNIQUE in SQL and rely on it to not store duplicates or should I make 
a select statement on the server side and check if the record already exists. Or both? 
Currently I am checking all the time using select statement
- So should we select first to see if it exist?
