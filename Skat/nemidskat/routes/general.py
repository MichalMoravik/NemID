The method has been started but not completele implemented - I didn't know how to reach out to the total amount that is in the user's bank account and I also
didn't manage to call the Tax Calculator function and substract from the account.
- The method should take a body with a UserId and the total amount of the user's bank account.
- There should be an initial check if the user has paid taxes (check Amount/IsPaid from SkatUserYear)
- The call to the Tax Calculator should be made, depending on its response the Amount and IsPaid in SkatUserYear should be updated
- The call to the Bank API should be made to substract money from the account
