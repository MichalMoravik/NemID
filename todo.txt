Things from requirements plus the following ones:

- add everywhere UNIQUE 
- docker
- Removing BankUser should remove all other tables - add constraints everywhere, also in other folders
- created_at and modified_at can be one row and should be called right before using to give the exact time

SKAT:
- pay-taxes will call withdrawal endpoint

Mandatory 2  todo.
 
SKAT:

BORGER.DK:
    - So, I wanted the address and the borgeruser to cascade the delete,
      but since, foreign_key is not enabled by default in sqlite3, there is
      some problems with that... have to query the database foreach each reference 
      with the same user id.. It works though! but could be implemented smarter
